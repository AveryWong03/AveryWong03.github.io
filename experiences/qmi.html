  <h1>Co-op at the Quantum Matter Institute</h1>
  <p style="opacity: 0.5;">
    My most recent co-op experience was at the Quantum Matter Institute at UBC, where I worked in an Ultra Fast Laser lab on a dual-comb spectroscopy experiment.

  <h2>Learnings Summary</h2>
  <p>
    From this co-op experience, I gained hands-on experience with the Vivado design suite, AMD Zynq SoCs, Python GUIs, and some introductory knowledge of laser/photonics setups.
  </p>

  <h2>The Project</h2>
  <p>
    For this dual-comb spectroscopy experiment, I was tasked with developing RTL for a <strong>Red Pitaya</strong> (Zynq SoC platform) in order to control the timing of trigger signals to an ablation laser and a data acquisition card (DAQ). 
    There was also a software component to this project, as I was to develop a Python GUI that was able to control/configure the Red Pitaya as well as the data acquisition card.
  </p>

  <h2>The Hardware</h2>
  <p>
    The main goal in developing the hardware was to recreate the following timing diagram. Without getting into specifics, the idea was to take the “Delta Frep Signal” as a reference pulse and use it to generate the “Ablation Trigger Signal” and “DAQ Trigger Signal” pulses with a configurable delay that would be output from the Red Pitaya’s GPIO pins.

  <p>
    To achieve this, I custom wrote RTL and verified the results both in simulation (testbenches and Vivado’s simulator) and in real time by using an oscilloscope to view the signals.

  <h2>The GUI</h2>
  <p>
    The significance of the GUI I developed was to combine configuration/operation of the instruments involved with timing (RTL) and data acquisition (DAQ card) into a single GUI. This allowed a much more streamlined setup process and operation for the timing and data acquisition components of the experiment. Below is a screenshot of some of the elements of the GUI.
  </p>

  <p>Significant features outside of pure operation include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data pre-formatting</li>
    <li>Data pre-processing</li>
    <li>Peak finding</li>
  </ul>
