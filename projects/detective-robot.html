    This project was for a <strong>team based</strong> ENPH project course that focuses on machine learning.
  </p>

  <h2>Learnings Summary</h2>
  <p>
    From this project, I learned how to train a TensorFlow neural network, how to use the OpenCV library, 
    and generally gained better proficiency with Python.
  </p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This project revolved around a simulated physics environment (<em>gazebo</em>) and developing a robot that was 
    capable of navigating the environment by following road lines, and reading “clues” off of signs using a neural network. 
    The two components of this project were the driving and the reading, of which I contributed to the reading.
